Chapter 2:
// = A comment
<< = The output operator that puts whatever is on the right side into the left side
C++ = A language that allows us to give very explicit instructions through a program
comment = Something written in english that allows us to read it easily rather than just reading the code. Also ignored by compiler
compiler = A program that will translate the source code to executable object code that can be run on a computer.
compile-time error = An error encoutered when trying to translate from source code to object code
cout = characters put into here will appear on screen. Means standard output stream.
executable = The code that appears after compilation. Can be run by a computer
function = A named sequence of statements that are run in the order they are written
header = Contains the definition of things we will use in the program
IDE = An integrated development environment. Gives us things as syntax highlighting and things like that
#include = Tells the compiler to make available from the file that is written after the include statement.
library = Functions that someone else has written that we can access found in the #include files.
linker = The program that is responsible for linking separate parts together into one executable file.
main() = The function that will be executed first.
object code = Code that is readable by the computer and can be executed.
output = What appears on the screen after calling cout.
program = A source code that can be compiled and ran into doing something.
source code = the code that is written in a human understandable way in a language.
statement = An action that the function will perform.

Chapter 3:
Assignment = Giving a variable a value by overriding the previous value of that variable
cin = For character input. Specifies where that input goes
concatenation = The putting of two strings together
conversion = Converting from one type to another
Declaration = The creation of a variable without assigning a value to it
decrement = To decrease the value of a variable by one
definition = Statement tha define a variable
increment = to increase the value of a variable by one
initialization = To initially give a variable a value
name = The name given to a variable for easy reference
narrowing = A conversion from a large max size variable to a smaller size variable
object = Places where we store data is an object
operation = Something a type of variable can do 
operator = A specific character that specifies a operator
type = The specific type of data a variable can be stored, declared in the declaration.
type safety = Converting between types can sometimes be unsafe. When objects are used only according to rules for their type
value = Set of bits in memory intrepreted according to type
variable = A named object
